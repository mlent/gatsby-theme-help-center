## Installation

### Using `gatsby new`

The easiest way to create a new Gatsby site with this theme is to use the [gatsby-starter-help-center](https://github.com/mlent/gatsby-starter-help-center) repo:

```bash
gatsby new your-site https://github.com/mlent/gatsby-starter-help-center
cd your-site
npm run develop # or yarn develop
```

Where `your-site` is the name of the directory you want to create the new site.

### Manually

The most up-to-date docs on installing a Gatsby theme can be found [on the Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/),
but here's a summary using this theme as an example:

```bash
npm install --save @mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center

# or

yarn add @mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center
```

Then edit your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center',
      options: {
        basePath: '/'
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## Customization

### Site Metadata

You will want to customize all the site metadata:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center',
      options: {
        basePath: '/'
      }
    }
  ],
  siteMetadata: {
    // Language settings
    htmlLang: 'en',
    contentLang: 'en-us',

    // Fallback title in case a title is not defined for the page
    title: 'Gatsby Help Center Theme',

    // Aside from the home page, this template will be used for all category/article pages
    titleTemplate: '%s Â· Gatsby Help Center Theme',

    // Meta description
    description: 'A help center theme for Gatsby.',

    // Base URL for your help center

    // Use for the og:site_name property
    siteName: 'A Help Center Theme for Gatsby',

    // Logo that appears in the top left corner

    ctaButtonUrl: 'https://github.com/mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center',

    // Text/url for secondary link next to call-to-action button
    linkText: 'See demo',
    linkUrl: 'https://gatbsy-theme-help-center.netlify.app/',

    // Main headline
    headline: 'How can we be helpful?',

    // Footer
    footerText: 'Back to main website',
    footerUrl: 'https://monicalent.com',

    // Google Analytics setup (Optional)
    googleTagManagerId: '',
    googleAnalyticsMeasurementId: '',
  }
}
```

### Add additional meta tags

You can shadow this file in order to add more custom meta tags (for example
site verification tags or other external scripts):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

export const CustomHead = () => (
  <Helmet>
    {/* Replace with whatever you want */}
  </Helmet>
);
```

Your file should be located at:
`src/@mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center/components/CustomHead.tsx`

### Content: Categories

Create your own YML file at `src/data/categories/data.yml` and provide as many categories
as you'd like in the following format:

```yml
- name: Get Started
  slug: getting-started
  description: Write helpful content about how to start using your product.
  image: /images/getting-started.svg
- name: FAQs
  slug: faqs
  description: Frequently asked questions that your user email you about.
  image: /images/faqs.svg
- name: Tutorials
  slug: tutorials
  description: Step-by-step guides for using various features in your app.
  image: /images/tutorials.svg
```

The illustrations from the sample site are from [Undraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).

### Content: Articles

Create new articles by creating mdx files in `src/data/pages` and providing the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Example Article No. 2
description: Example description that will go in the SEO description
author: Monica
categories: ["faqs"]
date: 2019-01-29
featured: true
relatedArticles: ["example-article"]
---

## What's up!

Hello fellow kids, this is another article.
```

> Note: The Author field is currently not used in the layout but may be in the future.

You may associate articles with more than one category and it will appear in both sections.

### Look and feel: Colors

Edit or create a file at `src/@mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center/themes/colors.ts` to customize colors:

```javascript
export const COLORS = {
  // This is used for the header stripe
  primary: {
    light: '#63ccff',
    main: '#4285f4',
    dark: '#006db3',
    contrastText: 'white',
  },
  secondary: {
    light: '#ff8cb3',
    dark: '#c51162',
    main: '#f50057',
    contrastText: 'white',
  },
  success: {
    light: '#ADE488',
    dark: '#237804',
    main: '#52c41a',
    contrastText: 'white',
  },
  pending: {
    light: '#F5E18C',
    dark: '#F6CC1B',
    main: '#F6CC1B',
    contrastText: 'white',
  },
  error: {
    light: '#F7CACA',
    dark: '#DB4D4D',
    main: '#DB4D4D',
    contrastText: 'white',
  },
};

```

`COLORS.primary` is used for the hero stripe and the colors of links. Just be sure to edit the `contrastText` so your
text has enough contrast to be legible depending on the primary colors you choose.

> **NOTE:** The other colors aren't used as part of the theme, but you're encouraged to use them
> for any custom components you end up developing.

If you like these colors and want some alternatives, you can find them on https://ant.design/docs/spec/colors

## Development

If you want to run this repo locally after cloning:

```bash
yarn
yarn workspace site develop # To run the demo site
yarn workspace @mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center # To run the theme itself
```

## Troubleshooting

### Failed to compile

```
Failed to compile
There was an error in your GraphQL query:

Cannot query field "contentLang" on type "SiteSiteMetadata".
```

This error can happen if you edit your `gatsby-config.js` file,
for instance adjusting the `basePath` option or switching from string
to object representation of listing the plugin.

**Solution:** Restart the development server.

### Index page is missing

Check whether you've set the `basePath` option to something besides `/`.

**Solution:** If, e.g. your `basePath` is `/test` you'll need to work locally at https://localhost:8000/test.

### Plugin has generated no Gatsby nodes

```
warn The @mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center plugin has generated no Gatsby nodes. Do you need it?
```

Yeah, I googled a bit about this but I'm not sure how to get rid of this warning. If you're a Gatsby wizz, help a sister out.
