Here's how to set up Google Analytics for this theme.

## Step 1. Open Google Analytics' Admin section

Navigate to <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a>
and click the "Admin" button in the left navigation menu.

## Step 2. Create a new Account or Property

Most likely, you just want a new property because the Help Center you're creating is
connected to an existing product.

In that case, choose "Create Property". Otherwise, choose "Create Account".

## Step 3. Copy the Tracking IDs into your gatsby-config

You will get a snippet from Google called the "Global Site Tag (gtag.js)", which looks something like this:

<img src="/images/tutorials/install-google-analytics/step-4.png" alt="Navigate to Admin section on Google Analytics" style="width: 100%"/>

```
<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-164700569-1"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'UA-164700569-3');
</script>
```
These IDs may be the same, or they may be different (for instance when you track multiple properties under the same account).

The value after `?id=` is the `googleTagManagerId`:

```
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_TAG_MANAGER_ID_HERE"></script>
```

And the ID being passed as the gtag config is the `googleAnalyticsMeasurementId`:

```
gtag('config', 'YOUR_GTAG_CONFIGURATION_ID_HERE');
```

Once you've found these IDs, provide them in your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@mlent/gatsby-theme-help-center',
      options: {
        basePath: '/'
      }
    }
  ],
  siteMetadata: {
    // ...your other configurations here
    googleTagManagerId: 'YOUR_TAG_MANAGER_ID_HERE',
    googleAnalyticsMeasurementId: 'YOUR_GTAG_CONFIGURATION_ID_HERE',
  }
}
```

Once you've successfully set up Google Analytics, you will see the page change to saying "1 active users right now" as seen in the screenshot below.
